## My Public Work

### Maven Flow

A collection of CI tools to solve common problems faced by teams developing software in Java with Maven using [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

- [maven-flow/merge](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/maven-flow-merge): A Github action for merging branches with automatic conflict resolution in changelog and `pom.xml` files.

- [maven-flow/prevent-artifact-overwrites](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/prevent-maven-artifact-overwrites) A Github action for preventing overwrites of Maven artifact versions from different feature branches.

### Changelog Merge Driver

<https://github.com/maven-flow/changelog-merge-driver>

A GIT merge driver for changelog files, which prevents conflicts when merging feature branches.

Technically a part of Maven Flow, but it can also be used locally as any other GIT merge driver.

### Reactive Feign

<https://github.com/Jardo-51/feign-reactive>

A reactive version of Feign - a popular Java framework for consuming REST APIs. Since the [original repo](https://github.com/PlaytikaOSS/feign-reactive) seems abandoned, I forked it, made it compatible with Spring Boot >= 3.2, and published the new version to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.jardoapps.reactivefeign/feign-reactor/4.1.0/jar?eh=).

### Kalkules

<https://www.kalkules.com/>

A hobby project I created at university. I'm keeping it alive mostly for nostalgic reasons.
